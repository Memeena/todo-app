## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- Used local storage to store the tasks and reuse it later.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Learnt React fundamentals like passing props to child components, lifting the state, CRUD operations, DRAG and DROP using OnDragStart, onDragEnd and drop event listeners and local storage to store the tasks for later usage, from this challenge.

Handled two arrays, one for displaying in the UI and the other the actual array of tasks. This helped to handle the filter elements based on the active,completed and all states.
